To align in the main-axis we can use justify-content.

- justify-content: flex-start; --- the first item stick on the main-start and the white space will be near to the main-end

- justify-content: flex-end; --- the last item stick on the main-end and the white space will be near to the main-start

- justify-content: center; --- it caulculate to be the same white space near to main-start as near to main-end

- justify-content: space-between; --- first item in the main-start and the last item in the main-end. the others one will be distributed in the middle

- justify-content: space-evenly; --- all items will have the same space between them, not sticking in the main-start or main-end.

- justify-content: space-around; --- in this case, all the .container will be divided by the number of itens. in each space, after the division, it will be positionaded in the center the items.

To align in the cross-axis we can use align-items

- align-items: strech; --- "esticar" if you grow the cross-axis, increasing the distance of cross-start and cross-end, the items will be streched.

- align-items: flex-start; --- it stick the items on the cross-start.

- align-items: flex-end; --- it stick the items on the cross-end.

- align-items: center; --- the items will be in the middle of the cross-axis.
