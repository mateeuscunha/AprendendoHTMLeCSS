Axis or Axes are the two axle (X and Y)

Flex-direction is applyied just in the father element.
-flex-direction: row; --- elements in a row: left to right
-flex-direction: row-reverse; --- right to left
-flex-direction: column; --- elemnts in a column: top to bottom
-flex-direction: column-reverse; --- bottom to top


Now, speaking about Axis...

Considering first the default set: flex-direction: row;

main-axis --- start on main-start and end on main-end
cross-axis (eixo transversal) --- cross-start and cross-end

The position of the main and the cross axis switch depending the flex-direction set.
