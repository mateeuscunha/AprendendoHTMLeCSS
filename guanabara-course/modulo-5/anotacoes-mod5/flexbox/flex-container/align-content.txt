ALIGN-CONTENT   !=   JUSTIFY-CONTENT

The align-content align content when the cross-axis is increased (it necessary have to involve wrapped elements).

Justify-content: main-axis
Align-items: cross-axis
Align-content: cross-axis, but with wrapped elements


/*thats all about wrapped (broken) elements*/

- align-content: stretch; --- divide all the space (of the cross-axis) in the number of rows broked. then, put all the elements in it and strech them. -- default value

- align-content: flex-start; --- it stick all the elements near to the cross-start. 

- align-content: flex-end; --- it stick all the elements near to the cross-end.

- align-content: center; --- it calculate to position the elements broked in the middle of the cross-axis.

- align-content: space-between; --- pick the first row and stick near to the cross-start, the last row it puts in the cross-end. so, if still remaining elements, they will be in the middle.

- align-content: space-evenly; --- the same space between the elements and the crosses (start and end).

- align-content: space-around; --- divide the cross-axis in the number of rows of content, so put in the middle of these divisions the elements itself.
